## Notebooks

### Tennis Club Survey

During my tenure on the board of a tennis club, I wrote and administered a survey of club members. This directory contains a notebook I developed to summarize the results in a Word document that was shared with the Board of Directors and club members.

The survey was created using Google Forms and responses were solicited through a weekly newsletter sent to club members. The survey contains logic for routing respondents based on their responses (respondents who have never visited the Pro Shop are not asked for more information about their satisfaction with its various aspects, for example).

A question on membership tenure was asked to help segment the results; however, the response rate was too low for this to be very effective (90 respondents / ~1,400 members).

In the original survey, open-ended responses were used to generate wordclouds and were included in their entirety in the Word document output for review by members of the board; here, they are omitted from the data because they contain names and other sensitive information.
